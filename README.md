# Audio Loader
A plugin for the [Decky Loader](https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/decky-loader) that allows users to replace Steam UI sounds and (eventually) add music when outside of a game.

# Overview
This plugin searches all folders in `/home/deck/homebrew/themes` for a `pack.json` file describing the music or sound pack. Users can install packs from the curated Pack Manager while connected to the internet or by manually adding folders (not recommended).

[Information on how to create, test, and upload a pack can be found here.](https://github.com/EMERALD0874/AudioLoader-PackDB)

# Installation
1. Install the [Decky Loader](https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/decky-loader).
1. Use the bundled Plugin Store to download the Audio Loader.
